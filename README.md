# What is Instagram Clone

As a frontend engineer candidate at Ruggable, I was asked to
build a login page with a heavy emphasis in UI/UX that would
allow users to create an account, login, sign out, and view a
protected route.

## Application URL

[Live Page](https://google.com)

## Authorization

This is a public application and no authorization is required
to access it.

## Common setup

Clone the repo (or extract the provided project folder) and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jadekang0611/instagram-clone.git

npm install
```
