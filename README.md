# What is Instagram Clone

As a frontend engineer candidate at Ruggable, I was asked to
build a login page with a heavy emphasis in UI/UX that would
allow users to create an account, login, sign out, and view a
protected route.

## Application URL

This is a public application and no authorization is required
to access it.

## Common setup
